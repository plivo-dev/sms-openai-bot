# SMS Bot using Plivo SDK and OpenAI API

This SMS bot is a simple Flask application that uses the Plivo SDK to receive SMS messages and the OpenAI API to answer questions sent via SMS.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mike-plivo/plivo-sms-openai-bot.git
cd plivo-sms-openai-bot
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Create .env file and add the required environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
PLIVO_AUTH_ID="your_plivo_auth_id"
PLIVO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_plivo_auth_token"
OPENAI_ENGINE="your_openai_engine"
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual OpenAI API key, Plivo Auth ID, Plivo Auth Token, and OpenAI engine.

## Running the Application

1. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python sms_bot.py
```

Your SMS bot is now up and running, listening for incoming SMS messages on the `/sms` endpoint.

## Deployment

To use this bot in production, you would need to deploy the Flask application to a server and set up a webhook in your Plivo account to point to the `/sms` endpoint of your deployed application. Make sure to properly secure your application and add error handling as necessary for production use.

## Note

This example is a simple implementation of an SMS bot and might not be suitable for production use without proper error handling and security measures.
